# React Portfolio

## Description
I created this updated portfolio to showcase my new projects after 6 months of learning and also as a an introduction to React as this is my first React project. I was able to use props and components to take a more modular apporach as opposed to defining the same project container or having to update a function to render these. I used state with my form which was my biggest challenge. I'm still not quite where I want to be in terms of understanding it, but I think it was a great introduction.
